<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a passion for game development, which I pursued as a personal project using Unreal Engine 5. 
  I completed two online courses on C++ and Unreal Engine 5, and I am working on creating my own 3D game with realistic graphics and physics. 
  Additionally, I have a web development background, having graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa, a web development boot camp. 
  I am proficient in Scrum, React Native, and REST APIs, and I have built several web applications with dynamic and responsive features. </p>
